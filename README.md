# Music-Recommendation-System

A Music Recommendation System is an application that aims to assist users in discovering new and relevant musical content based on their preferences and listening behaviour.

In this project, we will be using the spotify API to create a music recommendation system

The Spotify API is a set of rules and protocols provided by Spotify developers. It enables developers to interact with Spotifyâ€™s music catalogue and collect music-related data. 
Through the Spotify API, developers can access information such as tracks, albums, artists, playlists, user profiles, and play history, among other features, allowing them to build innovative applications 
and services that integrate seamlessly with the Spotify platform.

To build a Music Recommendation System using the Spotify API, we are required to collect real-time music data from Spotify. 
For this task, we need a Spotify developer account to get our credentials from Spotify to access their data.

Below is a step by step guide on how to get a spotify developer account

1. Create a spotify account
2. Go to Your Spotify Developer Dashboard (on your browser)
3.  Create An App
4.  Add your App description info
5.  Access your client ID and Client secret
